# Bk_Redux_Store

This application was refactored to use the open source JavaScript library Redux which remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application.
###
The E-commerce platform was modified to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API. When one reviews the appâ€™s store
one finds that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
The React front end accesses the store and finds that the app uses a Redux provider. The application passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API, extracts state data from the store and dispatches actions
###
The application was deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
